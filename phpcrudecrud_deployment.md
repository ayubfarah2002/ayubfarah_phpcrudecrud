# Section 1
The PHP Crude CRUD Application is designed for understanding and working with dynamic data-driven web applications.  
It creates a LAMP server on the local machine, utilizing MariaDB as the MySQL database to store and retrieve employee information. The application allows users to search for employees based on specified credentials, 
add new employees to the database, and view employee data in the form of an HTML table.
# Section 2
The general steps to create an entirely new application architecture and stack from the ground up for deploying the PHP Crude CRUD app involve several key steps. First, provision a virtual machine using Oracle's VirtualBox on your local machine. Next, install Apache and PHP on the virtual machine to create a local server for hosting PHP and HTML files. Store the files in the /var/www/html directory on the virtual machine. Finally, deploy the PHP Crude CRUD Application using the IP address and file location on the server in a web browser to access and interact with the application.
